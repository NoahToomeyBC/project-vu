            <p>Mental health in the United States is omnipresent and ostensibly just finding its place in the spotlight, losing the stigma and taboo that was once tied to its existence. The progress became almost insidious and mostly overlooked though as the Corona Virus Infection Disease 2019 (COVID-19) swept the world and, in turn, the United States. COVID-19, a more acute and visible pulmonary disease overwhelmed many Americans in terms of risk and resulting consequences. Across the country, Americans were infected with COVID-19, or probably more common they were infected with the fear of contracting it. This anxiety was coupled and even combined with quarantine, potential job loss, departed family, and lack of genuine social interaction. Perhaps, the ever existing and predisposed pressures of low income, ethnic vulnerabilities, and general access to health care played a part in the overlapping unease of COVID-19. By looking at mental health data over the last three years, using pre and post-COVID years, Team Yellow seeks to discover just what variables, whether because of COVID-19 or not, truly changed the mental health landscape. Then, with other studies, decisionmakers could be triggered to give a harder look at just what resources need to be allocated, or reallocated, to help those Americans in need.

            <h2>Results</h2>
                <p> During our analysis we found..e alone in the universe? For millennia, humans have turned to the sky to answer this question. Now, thanks to research generously funded by W. Avy, a UFO-enthusiast and amateur ufologist, we can supplement our sky-searching with data analysis.

                    "The release of this analysis is well-timed: It coincides with the celebration of World UFO Day, which is a moment for ufologists around the world to connect, relax, and sample a range of UFO-themed snacks," said Dr. Ursula F. Olivier, the world's preeminent expert on circular sightings. "Citizen-scientists can be especially helpful in both cataloguing sightings—which is hugely helpful for us in our search for aliens—and in helping us celebrate the work that has already been done, such as this data visualization project, which will help us raise awareness of the ubiquity of sightings!"
                    
                    Not everyone is ready to celebrate, however. Local CEO and vocal anti-alien activist V. Isualize reached out to our reporters to go on record as firmly opposed to any attempts to provide access to this data. "If there are aliens, they certainly would like to be left alone," she stated, before directing us to the Leave Aliens Alone (LAA) community engagement initiative she founded and funds.
